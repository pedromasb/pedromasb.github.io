      <description>Dimensionality reduction is one of the techniques that is present in the day-to-day work of scientists and data analysts. In this brief tutorial we will explore the use of different dimensionality reduction algorithms in Python for data visualization and exploration.
Using the data provided by the Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations (SILSO) on the monthly mean total sunspot number, we use two of the most popular dimensionality reduction algorithms: T-Distributed Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding (T-SNE) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), to &amp;ldquo;take a look&amp;rdquo; at the overall context of a 12-dimensional data set:</description>
