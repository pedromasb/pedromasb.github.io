      <description>I am a PhD student in Astrophysics &amp;amp; Data Science based in Madrid, Spain. My research is focused on the application of machine and deep learning techniques to large astronomical surveys. Previously, I worked as a Business Intelligence developer &amp;amp; consultant for an international IT consulting firm, where I was focused on data modelling and dashboard development with Qlik Sense.
Occasionally, I carry out freelance projects to provide Business Intelligence support, as well as teaching several courses both remotely and in person.</description>
