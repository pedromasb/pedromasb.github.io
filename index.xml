      <title>Interactive Plotting With Python: From Zero to Hero üöÄ</title>

      <description>Static data reporting is great when we want the user to focus on a specific view or behavior of the data. However, it can be limiting when the data is too complex or when we want to share different perspectives at the same time.
Interactive data sharing enables data discovery, giving users freedom to delve into the data, create their own contexts and discover new patterns and relationships that were not pre-established.</description>

      <title>Using Grid Search For Autoencoder Hyperparameter Tuning</title>
      <link>https://pedromasb.github.io/post/2023-05-16-using-grid-search-for-autoencoder/</link>

      <description>Finding the optimal combination of hyperparameters can be a tedious task when building a deep learning model. In this context, the grid search tuning technique is one of the most useful for hyperparameter optimization, and is accessible through the GridSearchCV class (documentation) of the scikit-learn package. Thanks to this technique, the user can evaluate the model for each hyperparameter combination throughout the desired parameter space.
In this brief tutorial we will build a deep autoencoder to reconstruct the images provided by the well known MNIST database of handwritten digits, which is available through the tensorflow.</description>

      <description>Dimensionality reduction is one of the techniques that is present in the day-to-day work of scientists and data analysts. In this brief tutorial we will explore the use of different dimensionality reduction algorithms in Python for data visualization and exploration.
Using the data provided by the Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations (SILSO) on the monthly mean total sunspot number, we use two of the most popular dimensionality reduction algorithms: T-Distributed Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding (T-SNE) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), to &amp;ldquo;take a look&amp;rdquo; at the overall context of a 12-dimensional data set:</description>

      <description>This January, I had the great opportunity to work for two nights at the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT), one of the many telescopes located at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma (Canary Islands). Apart from being one of the most renowned observatories in the world, Roque stands out for it unique location. At an altitude of 2396 meters above sea level, the landscape of the Taburiente National Park and the sea of clouds characteristic of La Palma, which is formed due to the exceptional conditions of the island, are truly breathtaking.</description>

      <description>Every sports and soccer fan ‚öΩÔ∏è has ever thought about how much we would like to have all the statistics of a league or competition at hand so that, beyond consulting them, we can carry out our own research. Imagine being able to analyze the performance of your favorite player or study the correlation between passing accuracy and points scored per team in a couple of seconds.
There are many websites where we can consult the squad of the different teams in a league, the statistics of each player&amp;hellip; but how to unify content that is segmented into hundreds of different URLs?</description>

      <title>The Structure of the Universe</title>

      <description>Have you ever wondered what the large-scale structure of our universe looks like? Currently, the ŒõCDM (Lambda Cold Dark Matter) model is the most widely accepted model for understanding the formation of structures in the universe. According to this model, small density fluctuations in the primordial universe grew exponentially due to inflation, which caused CDM to collapse in the overdense regions forming halos. Then, baryonic matter (&amp;lsquo;ordinary&amp;rsquo; matter) will gravitationally collapse into these CDM halos.</description>

      <title>Why Every World Map is Wrong</title>

      <description>Have you ever wondered how is it possible to represent the Earth on a 2D map? If you haven¬¥t, now is the time.
In fact, every map of the world you have looked at is wrong, or rather distorted. This is the result of the Mercator projection, which is famous for its ability to represent loxodromes (lines crossing all meridians at a constant angle) as straight segments. Objects are distorted because this projection deforms the distances between meridians into parallel lines, increasing their real widht more and more as it approaches the poles, and also enlarges the distance between parallels as it gets closer to the poles.</description>

      <description>In the twinkling of an eye, all was ready to execute Coppenole‚Äôs idea. Bourgeois, scholars and law clerks all set to work. The little chapel situated opposite the marble table was selected for the scene of the grinning match. A pane broken in the pretty rose window above the door, left free a circle of stone through which it was agreed that the competitors should thrust their heads. In order to reach it, it was only necessary to mount upon a couple of hogsheads, which had been produced from I know not where, and perched one upon the other, after a fashion.</description>

      <description>While the pensioner of Ghent and his eminence were exchanging very low bows and a few words in voices still lower, a man of lofty stature, with a large face and broad shoulders, presented himself, in order to enter abreast with Guillaume Rym; one would have pronounced him a bull-dog by the side of a fox. His felt doublet and leather jerkin made a spot on the velvet and silk which surrounded him.</description>

      <description>Poor Gringoire! the din of all the great double petards of the Saint-Jean, the discharge of twenty arquebuses on supports, the detonation of that famous serpentine of the Tower of Billy, which, during the siege of Paris, on Sunday, the twenty-sixth of September, 1465, killed seven Burgundians at one blow, the explosion of all the powder stored at the gate of the Temple, would have rent his ears less rudely at that solemn and dramatic moment, than these few words, which fell from the lips of the usher, ‚ÄúHis eminence, Monseigneur the Cardinal de Bourbon.</description>

      <description>Nevertheless, as be harangued them, the satisfaction and admiration unanimously excited by his costume were dissipated by his words; and when he reached that untoward conclusion: ‚ÄúAs soon as his illustrious eminence, the cardinal, arrives, we will begin,‚Äù his voice was drowned in a thunder of hooting.
‚ÄúBegin instantly! The mystery! the mystery immediately!‚Äù shrieked the people. And above all the voices, that of Johannes de Molendino was audible, piercing the uproar like the fife‚Äôs derisive serenade: ‚ÄúCommence instantly!</description>

      <description>Three hundred and forty-eight years, six months, and nineteen days ago to-day, the Parisians awoke to the sound of all the bells in the triple circuit of the city, the university, and the town ringing a full peal.
The sixth of January, 1482, is not, however, a day of which history has preserved the memory. There was nothing notable in the event which thus set the bells and the bourgeois of Paris in a ferment from early morning.</description>

      <description>I am a PhD student in Machine Learning &amp;amp; Astrophysics based in Madrid, Spain. My research is focused on the application of machine and deep learning techniques to large astronomical surveys. Previously, I worked as a Business Intelligence developer &amp;amp; consultant for an international IT consulting firm, where I was focused on data modeling and dashboard development with Qlik Sense.
Occasionally, I carry out freelance projects to provide Business Intelligence support, as well as teaching several courses both remotely and in person.</description>
