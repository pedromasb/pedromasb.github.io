      <title>Using Grid Search For Autoencoder Hyperparameter Tuning</title>

      <description>Finding the optimal combination of hyperparameters can be a tedious task when building a deep learning model. In this context, the grid search tuning technique is one of the most useful for hyperparameter optimization, and is accessible through the GridSearchCV class (documentation) of the scikit-learn package. Thanks to this technique, the user can evaluate the model for each hyperparameter combination throughout the desired parameter space.
In this brief tutorial we will build a deep autoencoder to reconstruct the images provided by the well known MNIST database of handwritten digits, which is available through the tensorflow.</description>

      <description>Dimensionality reduction is one of the techniques that is present in the day-to-day work of scientists and data analysts. In this brief tutorial we will explore the use of different dimensionality reduction algorithms in Python for data visualization and exploration.
Using the data provided by the Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations (SILSO) on the monthly mean total sunspot number, we use two of the most popular dimensionality reduction algorithms: T-Distributed Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding (T-SNE) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), to &amp;ldquo;take a look&amp;rdquo; at the overall context of a 12-dimensional data set:</description>

      <description>This January, I had the great opportunity to work for two nights at the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT), one of the many telescopes located at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma (Canary Islands). Apart from being one of the most renowned observatories in the world, Roque stands out for it unique location. At an altitude of 2396 meters above sea level, the landscape of the Taburiente National Park and the sea of clouds characteristic of La Palma, which is formed due to the exceptional conditions of the island, are truly breathtaking.</description>

      <description>Every sports and soccer fan ⚽️ has ever thought about how much we would like to have all the statistics of a league or competition at hand so that, beyond consulting them, we can carry out our own research. Imagine being able to analyze the performance of your favorite player or study the correlation between passing accuracy and points scored per team in a couple of seconds.
There are many websites where we can consult the squad of the different teams in a league, the statistics of each player&amp;hellip; but how to unify content that is segmented into hundreds of different URLs?</description>

      <title>The Structure of the Universe</title>

      <description>Have you ever wondered what the large-scale structure of our universe looks like? Currently, the ΛCDM (Lambda Cold Dark Matter) model is the most widely accepted model for understanding the formation of structures in the universe. According to this model, small density fluctuations in the primordial universe grew exponentially due to inflation, which caused CDM to collapse in the overdense regions forming halos. Then, baryonic matter (&amp;lsquo;ordinary&amp;rsquo; matter) will gravitationally collapse into these CDM halos.</description>

      <title>Why Every World Map is Wrong</title>

      <description>Have you ever wondered how is it possible to represent the Earth on a 2D map? If you haven´t, now is the time.
In fact, every map of the world you have looked at is wrong, or rather distorted. This is the result of the Mercator projection, which is famous for its ability to represent loxodromes (lines crossing all meridians at a constant angle) as straight segments. Objects are distorted because this projection deforms the distances between meridians into parallel lines, increasing their real widht more and more as it approaches the poles, and also enlarges the distance between parallels as it gets closer to the poles.</description>
